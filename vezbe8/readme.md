## Exercise 8 - Reactive Forms

You can find the implementation of this exercise in the directory `vezbe8/reactive-forms`.

In this exercise we will create a **reactive form** for user login on an e-commerce website. We will demonstrate the use of **FormControl**, **FormGroup**, **FormArray** and **FormBuilder** classes for work with forms, groups and controls. Other than that, we will also cover built-in and custom validators and error codes. We will use bootsrap for styling of the page.
