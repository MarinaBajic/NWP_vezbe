## Exercise 7 - Template Driven Forms (continued), Bootstrap Forms

You can find the implementation of this exercise in the directory `vezbe7/ecommerce-registration`.

In this exercise we will create a more advanced **template-driven form** for user registration on an e-commerce website. We will demonstrate the use of **ngForm**, **ngModelGroup**, and **ngModel** directives for work with forms, groups and controls. Besides that, we will also use **template reference variables** and **html pattern validation** with **regex expressions**. We will also demonstrate the use of **bootstrap forms** and **validation classes**.
